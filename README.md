# Welcome to RepoCleanup!
## What is RepoCleanup?
Repo Cleanup is a web application that removes spam issues from GitHub repositories and promotes helpful community engagement.

## What problem does RepoCleanup solve?
Open-source projects on GitHub are [polluted with spam issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nY_cy8zcO4) submitted by users farming for engagement. Even helpful issues are often posted without a relevant tag/label like “bug”, “feature”, “discussion”, etc. 

## How Does it Work?
Using a custom spam GitHub issues classifier trained on a custom, first-of-its-kind dataset, RepoCleanup allows users to fetch issues from any repository and label spam.
